<p>The first person to bring dolphins to live here on Grassy Key was a commercial fisherman named Milton Santini.  Back in the 1940s, he collected dolphins for other marine mammal parks and aquariums, as well as private individuals. Milton is responsible for creating our deep lagoons in the Gulf of Mexico waters (by blasting them out with dynamite) and establishing the first facility on these grounds – Santini’s Porpoise Training School.</p>
